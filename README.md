**Tasks** is an application that boosts computer performance and cleans computer files. **Tasks** has an advanced cleanup tool that allows you to clean application, cache files as well as uninstall unused browser extensions, clear cookies, and also remove bloatware. Tasks also include a startup manager that allows the modification of programs that run on startup.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Before you can run Tasks, you will need to install [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) directly from Microsoft.

### Tasks Executable file
After you installed **.NET Core**, get Tasks executable by:
1. Download the stable release from the **Releases** tab (don't download the source code!)
2. Extract the `.zip`, and execute the executable `.exe` file. After that, Tasks will launch.
Note that the dependencies must be kept in the same folder

## Support The Project
You can support our project in many ways, simply by using Tasks, leaving a star, forking, watching and reporting issues too. We also set up a donation system, so all your donations and sponsors go directly to us.
