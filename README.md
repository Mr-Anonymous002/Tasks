**Tasks** is an application which improves computer performance. **Tasks** has an advanced cleanup tool, allowing you to clean application, cache files as well as manage browser extensions, clear cookies and remove bloatware. Tasks also feature a startup manager, letting you control programs that run on startup.

## Installation
1. You will need to install [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). (If .NET Core is not installed, it will prompt you on opening Tasks.)
2. Download Tasks from the **Releases** tab.
3. Extract the `.zip` and execute the executable `.exe` file. After that, Tasks will launch.
Note that the dependencies must be kept in the same folder, we are working on a fix for this.

### Intentions
We aim to make a lightweight, free, intuitive and responsive cleaning tool. We believe that computer performance is crucial and does not include any hidden paywalls in the application.
